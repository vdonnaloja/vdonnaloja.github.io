I'm a *Leverhulme Early Career Fellow* in the Sociology department at the University of Essex. I completed my PhD in the department of Social Policy at the London School of Economics and spent a year at the European University Institute as a *Max Weber Fellow*. My PhD investigates how the function of citizenship is changing in response to migration, both for immigrants and for the majority population. Most recently, I have contributed new evidence on public attitudes on territorial birthright citizenship reform for Italy. In my new Leverhulme funded project I examine if and why higher education makes societies more positive about immigrants.
